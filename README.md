# Introduction to Artficial Intelligence

In this course I completed 4 major AI projects /

## Simple Reflex Agent and Vacuum Environment
### Vacuum Environment
There are two locations or boxes an agent can be in, each box either has the status "dirty" or "clean"

### Simple Reflex Agent
An agent can perceive its current location and whether the location is dirty or not. It will then either clean the location if it is dirty or move to the opposite location if that location is clean.

### Results
The performance score I used was -1 if the vacuum moved tiles, -1 if the vacuum cleans a tile and +10 if all the tiles are clean. This performance score best displays the true performance because it does not reward cleaning more squares and instead more effectively rewards completing the goal in a quick amount of time.
